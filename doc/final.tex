\section{Final Thoughts}\label{sec:final-thoughts}
In this project we have implemented an auction system which will distribute
simple math problems to several solvers which will solve simple problems which
together can build to larger problems.

The auction type implemented was quite simple, but could be extended to solve
more complex challenges if time would allow it. The interesting part of the
challenge was this auction which will distribute tasks out to other agents which
then can solve those problems. This means that the implemented code could quite
easily scale to larger problems with ease which in and of it self is quite the
task. This code could then be used to distribute problems to several agents on
different computers scaling to challenges much larger than the small problems
solved here.

In this assignment the problem was to decompose the problem while
also distributing subtasks to different agents. This was achieved, but the
decompose stage ended up becoming the bottleneck as it was done recursively,
meaning the distribution of tasks could not be done asynchronously.

All in all the problem was quite challenging and very fun, we learned a lot
about auctions in distributed agents and we had some challenges debugging
problems regarding this distribution.
